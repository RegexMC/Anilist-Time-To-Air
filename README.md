# Anilist Time To Air
A small chrome extension that displays the time till the first or next episode of anime airs within the /animelist section of AniList.

Made at request as currently that is only displayed in the home page for in progress anime or when you click into each anime which can get tedious. 

*Poorly made but gets the job done.
